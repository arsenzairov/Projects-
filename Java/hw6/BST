Create a class BSTMap that implements the Map61B interface using a BST (Binary Search Tree) as its core data structure. 
You must do this in a file named BSTMap.java. 
Just as in HW5, your implementation is required to implement all of the methods given in Map61B except for remove and keyset.

In your implementation you should assume that generic keys K in BSTMap<K,V> extend Comparable.
